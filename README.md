- Deploy the generated file `iccr-pkg-<VERSION>.tgz` to your server.

## How to use?

which executes  the JAR file in `/opt/iccr/lib/iccr.jar`.
- The properties can be defined or altered in `/opt/iccr/conf/iccr.properties`.
- The iccr process logs in `/opt/iccr/logs`.
- It logs event data in CSV format to an audit file contained in `/opt/iccr/data`.
- It copies downloaded IOTA IRI files into `/opt/iccr/download`.
- It maintains backup copies of previous IOTA IRI file version in `/opt/iccr/bak`.
